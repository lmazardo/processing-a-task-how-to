# Processing a task (how to)
## 1 - **Question** it
Did you understand the task? Does it make sense to you? Does it make sense as part of the whole project? Have you all the required information and material to work on that task?

## 2 - **Concept**ualize a solution
First thing first, think about what you want to accomplish. How will you do it ? Take the time to think and elaborate a plan that seems smart to you.

## 3 - Call for a peer **design review**
Before going any further ask your peers to review your plan.
They may have experience about the kind of issue you're trying to solve. Allow them to share tricks and knowledge with you, stay open minded, it's potentially time to learn something. They possibly already have took that path and can avoid you to reach a dead end. It's time for you to explain your choices and see if they seems obvious or weird / clumsy to others, or even if you feel uncomfortable justifying them.

## 4 - **Implement** the design
Now that you and your peers agreed on the path to take, it's time for you to implement the solution. Having think about it before instead of jumping in head first, you will probably implement it faster.

## 5 - **Test** your work
Before asking anyone to take a look at your work, you must be sure it does what it is intended for. It's unpleasant for the reviewer to discover a non functional implementation, and it's no more pleasant to show a broken code to others.

## 6 - Ask for a peer **code review**
Now it's time to ask your fellows a code review. Having discussed with you earlier about the path you should have taken to implement the solution you shouldn't have to discuss about big mistakes anymore. You should only have little details to review like coding style or variables nomenclature. It will avoid great frustration for you as you won't rewrite a full two days work, or worst trying to patch a bad implementation to fit reviewers expectations.

## 7 - **Check** it in pre-production
You **must** check it in pre-production environment as it may differ from your development one.

## 8 - **Deliver** it â†’ switch to next task
You're doing a great job :)
